# Dice-Roller-PROGRAM
A simple JavaScript dice game where clicking “Start” rolls two dice for Player 1 and Player 2. Dice images update based on random rolls, and the game displays a message declaring the winner or a draw. It showcases DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic updates using template literals.
